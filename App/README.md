# Stateful Firewall Application Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a stateful firewall that inspects network packets and applies rules defined in a configuration file. The firewall is able to log actions, perform stateful inspection, and trigger email alerts when a specified packet threshold is reached. The system also monitors and updates firewall rules in real-time by watching for changes in the rule file.

The firewall is built using the Scapy library for packet capture and analysis, Pythonâ€™s threading for monitoring file changes, and JSON for configuration and logging.

### Features

- **Stateful Packet Inspection**: The firewall inspects each incoming packet in the context of its state, allowing or denying traffic based on rules defined in the configuration.
- **Dynamic Rule Monitoring**: Rules are loaded from a JSON file, and changes in this file are automatically detected and applied in real-time by a background thread.
- **Rule-based Actions**: Rules define actions to take upon packet matches, including:
  - **Allow**: Permit the packet to pass through.
  - **Deny**: Block the packet.
  - **Mail**: Trigger an alert via email if a specified threshold is reached (e.g., if a certain number of "MAIL" actions occur).
- **Logging**: Every event and action taken by the firewall (e.g., packet matches, rule changes) is logged in a JSON file, with timestamps for each log entry.
- **Alerting via Email**: When the packet matches a rule with the "MAIL" action and a threshold (from settings) is reached, an alert email is sent to a predefined recipient.
- **Threshold-based Alerts**: The system supports a mail threshold setting, limiting how many alerts are sent in a given time frame to prevent excessive emailing.
- **Configurable Rule File**: The firewall rules are read from a user-defined JSON file, which can be updated without restarting the system. A background thread monitors this file for changes and automatically reloads the rules.
- **Scalable and Modular**: The system is designed to be scalable with additional rules and inspection capabilities. It also allows for modular extensions (e.g., new rule actions, logging mechanisms).
- **Multithreading**: The rule file monitoring is handled in a separate thread, ensuring the system does not block other processes while monitoring for changes.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The system is implemented in Python, using the Scapy library for packet analysis, ensuring compatibility across multiple platforms (Linux, Windows).

## Components

### 1. `index.py`

The main entry point of the application. It sets up the firewall system, loads rules, starts packet capture, and continuously monitors the rule file for updates.

#### Key Functions:

- **`packet_handler(packet, firewall)`**: This function handles incoming packets and performs stateful inspection on them.
- **`main()`**: The core function that initializes the firewall, logger, and rule monitor, and starts packet capture.

### 2. `logger.py`

Handles logging for the application. It logs messages to a JSON file, ensuring that logs are stored with a timestamp and are retrievable for later review.

#### Key Functions:

- **`__init__(log_file_path)`**: Initializes the logger and ensures the log directory exists.
- **`ensure_log_directory_exists()`**: Creates the log directory if it does not exist.
- **`log(message)`**: Logs a message with the current timestamp. It appends the message to the log file in JSON format.

### 3. `mailer.py`

Handles sending email alerts when the firewall encounters certain conditions, such as exceeding a specified threshold for packet filtering actions.

#### Key Functions:

- **`send_alert_email(subject, body)`**: Sends an email alert to the receiver with the given subject and body.
- **Email Configuration**: Loads Gmail credentials from a `.env` file for authentication.

### 4. `rule_file_monitor.py`

Monitors the rule configuration file for any changes and updates the firewall rules accordingly.

#### Key Functions:

- **`__init__(rule_loader, firewall, interval=5)`**: Initializes the file monitor, setting up the interval to check for file changes.
- **`run()`**: Continuously checks the rule file for changes. If a change is detected, it reloads the rules and updates the firewall.
- **`stop()`**: Stops the monitoring thread.

### 5. `rule_loader.py`

Responsible for loading and parsing firewall rules from a JSON file. Each rule is represented as an instance of the `Rule` class.

#### Key Functions:

- **`__init__(json_file)`**: Initializes the rule loader with the path to the rules JSON file and loads the rules.
- **`load_rules()`**: Loads and parses the rules from the JSON file.
- **`get_rules()`**: Returns the list of loaded rules.

### 6. `rule.py`

Represents a firewall rule, including its attributes and the logic for matching packets against these rules.

#### Key Functions:

- **`__init__(id, source_ip, destination_ip, source_port, destination_port, protocol, action)`**: Initializes the rule with its attributes.
- **`__str__()`**: Returns a string representation of the rule.
- **`matches(packet)`**: Checks if a given packet matches the rule based on its attributes (IP, port, protocol).

### 7. `stateful_firewall.py`

The core of the firewall, performing packet inspection and logging actions based on the defined rules.

#### Key Functions:

- **`__init__(rules, logger)`**: Initializes the firewall with a list of rules and a logger.
- **`load_mail_threshold()`**: Loads the threshold for the number of mail actions before an email alert is triggered.
- **`update_rules(rules)`**: Updates the list of rules in the firewall.
- **`check_packet(packet)`**: Checks a packet against the current rules and returns the action to take (ALLOW, DENY, or MAIL).
- **`handle_mail_action(packet_info)`**: Increments a counter and sends an email alert when the mail threshold is reached.
- **`log_packet(packet_info, action)`**: Logs the packet information and the action taken.
- **`extract_packet_info(packet)`**: Extracts relevant information (IP, port, protocol) from a packet.
- **`perform_stateful_inspection(packet)`**: Performs the packet inspection and executes the appropriate action (ALLOW, DENY, MAIL).

## Configuration

- **Rules File**: The firewall rules are loaded from a JSON file specified in the `RuleLoader` class. This file defines conditions for matching packets, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and actions (ALLOW, DENY, or MAIL).

  Example rule entry:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "source_ip": "192.168.1.1",
      "destination_ip": "any",
      "source_port": "any",
      "destination_port": "80",
      "protocol": "TCP",
      "action": "ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "source_ip": "any",
      "destination_ip": "any",
      "source_port": "any",
      "destination_port": "any",
      "protocol": "ICMP",
      "action": "DENY"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "source_ip": "any",
      "destination_ip": "any",
      "source_port": "any",
      "destination_port": "any",
      "protocol": "TCP",
      "action": "MAIL"
    }
  ]
  ```

- **Settings File**: The `settings.json` file is used to configure the email threshold for triggering alerts. The default threshold is set to 10.

  Example settings file:

  ```json
  {
    "MAIL_threshold": 10
  }
  ```

## Running the Application

1. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Gmail credentials.
     ```
     GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
     GMAIL_PASS=your-password
     RECEIVER_EMAIL=receiver-email@example.com
     ```

2. **Start the application**:

   - Run the `index.py` script to start the packet capture and firewall inspection:
     ```bash
     python index.py
     ```

3. **Monitor logs**:

   - Logs are stored in the `files/logs.json` file. You can inspect the log to track packet actions and rule changes.

4. **Update firewall rules**:
   - The application continuously monitors the rules file for changes. If the file is updated, the new rules are automatically loaded.
